Web server
***

A web server is a computer system that processes requests via HTTP, the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the World Wide Web. 
The term can refer to the entire system, or specifically to the software that accepts and supervises the HTTP requests.


The most common web server software today, that is, the program that actually does the receiving and answering of page requests, is Apache. This open-source software handles more than half of all websites in existence today - many developers of web-based applications and technologies use Apache as their default environment when designing new products. The second most common is Internet Information Services (IIS), released by Microsoft, which accounts for nearly 25% of all websites, leaving various other smaller applications to compete for the remaining niche.
