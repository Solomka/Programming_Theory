F5 - Executes the currently selected line and goes to the next line in your program. If the selected line is a method call the debugger steps into the associated code.
F6 - steps over the call, i.e. it executes a method without stepping into it in the debugger.
F7 - steps out to the caller of the currently executed method. This finishes the execution of the current method and returns to the caller of this method.
F8 - tells the Eclipse debugger to resume(продовжувати)the execution of the program code until is reaches the next breakpoint or watchpoint.
