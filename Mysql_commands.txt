MySQL is a database server (which comes with a command line client for it)
PHPMyAdmin is a (web application) client for MySQL.



MySql is server where your commands get executed and returns you data, It manages all about data while PhpMyAdmin is a web Application, with user friendly, easy to use GUI makes it easy to handle database, which is difficult to use on command line. So this will write and run commands for you on MySql server for you.

phpMyAdmin does not have same data as MySQL command line?

Sounds like you have MAMP's version of MySQL and a standalone MySQL. 

How can I access the MySQL command line with XAMPP for Windows?

Your MySQL binaries should be somewhere under your XAMPP folder. Look for a /bin folder, and you'll find the mysql.exe client around. Let's assume it is in c:\xampp\mysql\bin, then you should fireup a command prompt in this folder.

That means, fire up "cmd", and type:

cd c:\xampp\mysql\bin
mysql.exe -u root -p
If you want to use mysqldump.exe, you should also find it there.

Log into your mysql server, and start typing your commands.

XAMP
***

A web server is a computer system that processes requests via HTTP, the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the World Wide Web. The term can refer to the entire system, or specifically to the software that accepts and supervises the HTTP requests.

XAMPP (/ˈzæmp/ or /ˈɛks.æmp/[2]) is a free and open source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends,[2] consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages.

***
ON UPDATE/ ON DELETE
***

* CASCADE
* SET NULL
* RESTRICT: Rejects the delete or update operation for the parent table. 
 Specifying RESTRICT (or NO ACTION) is the same as omitting the ON DELETE or ON UPDATE clause.
* NO ACTION: A keyword from standard SQL. In MySQL, equivalent to RESTRICT. The MySQL Server rejects the delete or update operation for the parent table if there is a related foreign key value in the referenced table. Some database systems have deferred checks, and NO ACTION is a deferred check. In MySQL, foreign key constraints are checked immediately, so NO ACTION is the same as RESTRICT.
* SET DEFAULT

For an ON DELETE or ON UPDATE that is not specified, the default action is always RESTRICT.
